# Go CMS Research Summary

## Current Status

We have successfully removed all Strapi-related code and reverted to the original database-driven blog system in Buffalo. The application now uses Buffalo's built-in Pop/Soda ORM for all content management operations.

## Go-Based CMS Options Research

### 1. Ponzu CMS
**Repository**: https://github.com/ponzu-cms/ponzu
**Status**: Mature, actively maintained
**Type**: Headless CMS and HTTP server framework

#### Pros:
- Pure Go implementation
- Built-in admin interface with content editor
- HTTP/2 support with server push
- RESTful API for content management
- Built-in search functionality
- Extensive interface system for customization
- Content approval workflow (Pending → Published)
- File upload and media management
- Multi-format output support

#### Cons:
- Separate application (not a library to integrate)
- Requires learning Ponzu's content type system
- May be overkill for our current blog system
- Would require significant refactoring

#### Integration Complexity: High
- Would require restructuring our entire content system
- Content types would need to be redefined in Ponzu format
- Templates would need major changes
- Database schema would be completely different

### 2. Hugo (Static Site Generator)
**Repository**: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo
**Status**: Very active, large community
**Type**: Static site generator

#### Pros:
- Extremely fast build times
- Excellent for performance and SEO
- Great for documentation sites
- Large theme ecosystem
- Built-in multilingual support

#### Cons:
- Static only - no dynamic admin interface
- Not suitable for user-generated content
- Would eliminate our dynamic SaaS features
- Not a good fit for our Buffalo application

#### Integration Complexity: Not Applicable
- Would require complete architecture change from dynamic to static
- Incompatible with Buffalo's dynamic SaaS model

### 3. Current Buffalo + Pop/Soda Approach
**What we have**: Database-driven CMS using Buffalo's built-in ORM

#### Pros:
- Already integrated and working
- Familiar Buffalo patterns
- Consistent with our tech stack
- Simple to maintain and extend
- Full control over implementation
- Works perfectly with our authentication system

#### Cons:
- Basic feature set compared to dedicated CMS
- No built-in advanced features (media library, workflows, etc.)
- Manual implementation of CMS features

## Recommendation

**Stick with the current Buffalo + Pop/Soda approach** for the following reasons:

1. **Alignment with Project Goals**: Our dependency guidelines prioritize Go-only, self-contained solutions
2. **Simplicity**: The current system is working and fits our needs
3. **Buffalo Ecosystem**: Leverages Buffalo's strengths rather than working against them
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and debug within our existing codebase
5. **Incremental Enhancement**: We can add CMS features gradually as needed

## Future Enhancement Strategy

Instead of integrating a separate CMS, we should enhance our current system incrementally:

### Phase 1 (Current - Basic Blog System)
- ✅ CRUD operations for blog posts
- ✅ Admin interface
- ✅ SEO-friendly URLs
- ✅ Rich text editor (Quill.js)

### Phase 2 (Media Management)
- [ ] File upload system for images
- [ ] Image resizing and optimization
- [ ] Media library interface

### Phase 3 (Content Organization)
- [ ] Categories and tags system
- [ ] Content search and filtering
- [ ] Bulk operations

### Phase 4 (Advanced Features)
- [ ] Content scheduling
- [ ] Revision history
- [ ] Multi-author support
- [ ] Content analytics

### Phase 5 (Multi-Content Types)
- [ ] Pages (beyond blog posts)
- [ ] Custom content types
- [ ] Form builder

## Implementation Approach

1. **Use Buffalo Generators**: Leverage `buffalo generate resource` for new content types
2. **Follow Buffalo Patterns**: Use ActionSuite for testing, middleware for auth
3. **Enhance Incrementally**: Add one feature at a time
4. **Go-Only Dependencies**: Only add Go modules that enhance Buffalo's capabilities
5. **Database-First**: Use Pop/Soda migrations for all schema changes

## Conclusion

The research confirms that our current approach of using Buffalo's built-in capabilities is the best fit for our project. Rather than introducing external CMS complexity, we should focus on incrementally enhancing our existing system with Go-only libraries that integrate well with Buffalo.

The Strapi removal was the correct decision, and we now have a solid foundation to build upon using pure Go solutions that align with our dependency guidelines.
