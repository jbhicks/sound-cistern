# Sound Cistern Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Buffalo Framework Adherence
Always utilize out-of-the-box capabilities provided by the Buffalo Framework and Plush templates. Avoid reinventing the wheel; check available features first. If major additions are needed, backport them to the template for future SaaS products.

### II. Performance Optimization
Architect the site to minimize initial page load times. Avoid direct API calls to Soundcloud on user login; implement continuous database updates for user tracks and trim older entries.

### III. Freemium Model
Provide the base application free to use, with core features like standard feed filtering. Offer paid features for extended feed length or custom track lists.

### IV. Continuous Data Management
Implement mechanisms for continuous updating of the database with latest Soundcloud tracks for each user, ensuring data freshness without impacting user experience.

### V. Simplicity and Efficiency
Build a simple, fast service focused on providing saved feeds. Prioritize efficiency in all implementations.

## Technical Constraints
Use Go language with Buffalo framework. Database for user data and tracks. Integrate with Soundcloud API for feed data.

## Development Practices
Follow test-driven development. Ensure code is testable and maintainable. Use version control best practices.

## Governance
The constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan. All changes must verify compliance with principles.
