# Feature Specification: Sound Cistern

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-sound-cistern`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create Sound Cistern: an application that provides robust filtering of your Soundcloud feed, because they are too lazy to provide it themselves! I have been granted a soundcloud API key that we can use to access soundcloud's API. We should create a reference/ directory and download all relevant documentation there for easy reference - the Soundcloud API, the Buffalo framework docs, and anything else that will be relevant to have in context. This will use my Saas template at https://github.com/jbhicks/my-go-saas-template, which uses Go and the Buffalo framework. Stick to Buffalo OOTB capability unless absolutely impossible. Decide to use Javascript with the utmost discretion, try to keep to only Go Buffalo / Plush template functionality. We should have a simple site that presents a login via soundcloud if not logged in along with some basic splash screen style messaging. Use Pico.css for basic styling defaults, and find a good example to follow of a beautiful site using Pico.css as an easy example to follow for good styling. The user, after logging in via Soundcloud, should be presented with their Soundcloud feed. Obviously this has to be loaded on demand the first time, but subsequent visits should provide a regularly updated list straight from database without having to hit the soundcloud api. We need to have a beautiful filter bar with controls for track length filtering, selecting/un-selecting genre tags, as well as time the track was posted. We should also provide a text-based quick filter."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
    ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
    ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
    ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
    ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
    ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
    ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
    ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
    ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
    - User types and permissions
    - Data retention/deletion policies
    - Performance targets and scale
    - Error handling behaviors
    - Integration requirements
    - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: What are the performance targets for feed loading? ‚Üí A: 2s max
- Q: How should the system handle Soundcloud API failures? ‚Üí A: Show cached data with warning
- Q: What security measures are needed for user authentication and data? ‚Üí A: nothing extra besides the template
- Q: What is the expected scale for number of users and tracks? ‚Üí A: small
- Q: What are the data retention policies for cached feeds? ‚Üí A: 2 weeks

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Soundcloud user, I want to filter my feed by track length, genre, and post time to easily discover long DJ mixes without manual searching.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am not logged in, **When** I visit the site, **Then** I see a login button for Soundcloud and a splash screen with messaging about the app.
2. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I visit the site, **Then** I see my Soundcloud feed loaded from the database.
3. **Given** I am on the feed page, **When** I use the filter bar, **Then** tracks are filtered by length, genre, post time.
4. **Given** I enter text in the quick filter, **When** I type, **Then** the feed is filtered in real-time.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the Soundcloud API is unavailable? The system should display cached data with a warning message.
- How does the system handle no tracks matching the applied filters? It should show an empty state with guidance to adjust filters.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow login via Soundcloud.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display user's Soundcloud feed after login.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide filter bar for track length, genre tags, and post time.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a text-based quick filter.
- **FR-005**: System MUST use Pico.css for styling.
- **FR-006**: System MUST display a splash screen for unauthenticated users.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents authenticated Soundcloud user, with ID, access token.
- **Track**: Represents a Soundcloud track, with fields like title, length, genre, post time, user ID.
- **Feed**: Collection of tracks for a user.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Feed loading MUST complete within 2 seconds.
- **NFR-002**: Security handled by template; no extra measures needed.
- **NFR-003**: System MUST support small scale.
- **NFR-004**: Cached feeds MUST be retained for 2 weeks.
